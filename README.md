[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oniony/TMSU.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oniony/TMSU)

Important
=========

This branch is an experiment in reimplementing TMSU in the Rust programming language.
Functionality has not completely been ported.

Overview
========

TMSU is a tool for tagging your files. It provides a simple command-line utility
for applying tags and a virtual filesystem to give you a tag-based view of your
files from any other program.

TMSU does not alter your files in any way: they remain unchanged on disk, or on
the network, wherever your put them. TMSU maintains its own database and you
simply gain an additional view, which you can mount where you like, based upon
the tags you set up.

Usage
=====

Before you can get tagging, you'll need to initialise a TMSU database:

    $ cd ~
    $ tmsu init

This database will be used automatically whenever you are under that
directory. In this case we created one under the home directory.

You can tag a file by specifying the file and the list of tags to apply:

    $ tmsu tag banana.jpg fruit art year=2015

Or you can apply tags to multiple files:

    $ tmsu tag --tags="fruit still-life art" banana.jpg apple.png

You can query for files with or without particular tags:

    $ tmsu files fruit and not still-life

Mount the virtual filesystem to an empty directory:

    $ mkdir mp
    $ tmsu mount mp
    
A subcommand overview and detail on how to use each subcommand is available via the
integrated help:

    $ tmsu help
    $ tmsu help tags

Documentation is maintained online on the wiki:
